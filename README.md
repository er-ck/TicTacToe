# TicTacToe
A simple TicTacToe game in java

This only supports 2 player TicTacToe atm. 

Instructions:
Play as normal by clicking the tile you want; when a winner is detected, the winning X/O will be shown on the screen alongside their score.
You can press the spacebar at any time to reset the game, but the total number of wins for each X / O will only reset by closing and running the game again.
